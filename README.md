# Shairport Sync Docker Build Environment

This is a Docker setup for a Shairport Sync build environment. It creates a full build environment for Shairport Sync and then builds it. It does not remove all the build stuff and create a smaller runtime image.

This is a very volatile respository at present. Please do not rely on it.
